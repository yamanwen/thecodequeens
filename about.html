    <h1> Let us introduce you the web developers behind the Codequeens</h1>
    We are three Code First: Girls alumni, each with very different lives, but one shared passion: coding!<br>
    We love to create websites and help you build a platform that's perfect for your blog, webshop, or whatever you want.

    <h2>Charlotte</h2>
    My name is Charlotte. I am from the Netherlands but I have lived in various places in the world, and am currently residing in London.<br>
    I like to cook and try out new recipes, but also love to go out for dinner with friends and enjoy good wines or craft beers.<br> </br>
    I look forward to working together with you on a website!
  </p>

    <h2>Rossana</h2>
    My name is Rossana (to be pronounced with a strong Italian accent) and I adore exploring the world, learning new things and talking to people.<br>
    My Mediterranean roots explain my absolute love for the sunshine, good food and outdoor activites.<br> 
    Can't wait to start working on your new project and put my coding skills at your disposal!
